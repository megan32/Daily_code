-what a good day. After yesterday being really crummy code & programming wise, I just took a step back and did some learning. 
-It was a low output day, but a good input day
-I really think I was inadvertenly skipping over some big learning steps trying to produce things; Looking back Codecademy was a pretty solid waste of time, they hold your hand so much it's too easy to end up not retaining information. I'm apparenlty more of a watch and then do learner.

### Day 24	:	Thursday	26-Jan
**Today's To-do**: 
1. Dojo Pre-work -completed all readings, challenges, and the test
**Thoughts/Notes**
so glad I started codewars -big help in plugging through these, but also feel like I need to gear up and do more
The pre-work wasn't bad, just some basic readings and simple codes. The hardest part was the end quiz. Not so much that the problems were difficult, just that the submission system doesn't tell you want you got wrong, but you need to get 100%. You don't know what you need to go back and review, instead just repeatedly doing the tests, assuming you were wrong somewhere...
